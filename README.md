# DSA2 Graph Activity
1. Create a 3x3 matrix representing a 3 node graph
2. Perform matrix multiplication to determine paths of length 2
3. Create a 7 node graph.
   - perform DFS and BFS
   - add weights to the graph
   - perform Prim's and Kruskal's MST algorithm
   - perform Dijkstra's single source shortest path
4. Create a directed graph and the adjacency matrix
   Determine indegree and outdegree


Create a 9 element list of integers, 1..9
  buildHeap()
  insert()
  serve()
